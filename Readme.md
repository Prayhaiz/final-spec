

Welcome To another training lesson Kelvin Powell and also Oga David aka demicoder i was able to do this desig without stress. 
    Honestly not much stress and effort was used cause of all the basis i was taught all tha nks to "Conquering Responsive Layout wiht Flexbox"it wa pretty easy.

    Well i used flexbox mostly as my layout and i completed the mobile design followed by the tablet and finally the desktop design. So do well to check it and most importantly check for overflows and text or picture alignment isues and do give us a feedback, it would be much appreciated
